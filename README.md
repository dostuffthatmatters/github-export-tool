A script that downloads everything from a list of github organizations and users.

-   [x] Code (with all branches and tags)
-   [ ] Issues
-   [ ] Pull Requests
-   [ ] Releases
-   [ ] LFS items

This can be used to periodically backup your whole organization. Existing tools that do this backup are crazy expensive (like https://rewind.com/pricing-backups/). And export via a migration is only available for GitHub enterprise.
